Challenge 4 - Missing numbers
Here at Tuenti we use integer numbers a lot. We store all of them (only non-negative integers, from 0 to 2^31-1)	in a binary file inside a USB drive. Yesterday, while playing rollerball, we accidentally dropped it. Integers were shuffled around and we have lost 100 of them. We are really devastated. Help us find the missing ones!

Here you have a (7z) file with the current content of the USB drive, and just to be sure you are reading it correctly, the first number in the file is 2147459344.

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases, T, and T cases follow (each one in a different line). Each test case consists of one integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), indicating that you must find the Nth missing integer in the file (in ascending order).

Output

The Nth missing number in the file, in a different line for each test case.

Example

Suppose that all numbers from 0 to 107 are in the file, and that 108 is the first integer missing in the file. Then, if you are asked to provide the 1st missing number, you will have to ouput 108.
